I am currently in the process of designing a custom Arcade Stick PCB. The MCU I chose for this project is the Atmega32U4.

This is how the schematic is currently looking like:

I am still working on the schematic portion and have not yet started with the PCB Design part.

<h1>UPDATE</h1>

<p>I managed to update the schematic of the push buttons, as the previous arrangement was incorrect.</p>

<p>I also connected a 16MHz crystal to the ATMega32U4 schematic for removing any sort of delay with the input of the buttons.</p>
